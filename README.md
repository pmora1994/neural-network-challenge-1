# neural-network-challenge-1

This project focused on developing a neural network model to predict loan repayment success. Throughout this process, I gained valuable insights into various aspects of machine learning and data preprocessing.

Key Learnings:
Data Preprocessing: I learned the importance of preparing data for machine learning. This included scaling features for better model performance and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Architecture: Designing a neural network taught me how to structure layers effectively, including hidden layers and output neurons. I gained hands-on experience in selecting the number of nodes and activation functions.

Model Training and Evaluation: Compiling, fitting, and evaluating the model helped me understand the significance of epochs, batch sizes, and validation. I learned how to interpret loss and accuracy metrics to assess model performance.

Making Predictions: Implementing predictions and rounding them to binary results reinforced the concept of transforming probabilities into actionable insights.

Performance Metrics: Using classification reports helped me appreciate the importance of metrics such as precision and recall in evaluating model effectiveness.

This project has solidified my understanding of machine learning concepts and has inspired me to explore further applications in financial analytics and beyond.
